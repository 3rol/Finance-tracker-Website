Finance Tracker is a web application designed to help you manage your personal finances. It is built using the Laravel framework and Inertia.js, which connects the backend to a React-based frontend. This setup allows for a smooth and easy-to-use interface where you can keep track of your transactions, set savings goals, and manage your bills and payments.
